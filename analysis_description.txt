Customer Segmentation and Promotion Assignment (KMeans Clustering)
==================================================================

1. Data Loading and Preprocessing
---------------------------------
- Loaded customer data from 'sample_customer_data.csv'.
- Encoded categorical columns ('FavDish', 'TimePref', 'Location') using LabelEncoder to convert them into numeric values suitable for clustering.
- Selected relevant features for clustering: TotalSpend, Frequency, AOV, and the encoded categorical columns.

2. Feature Scaling
------------------
- Applied StandardScaler to normalize all features, ensuring each feature contributes equally to the clustering process.

3. KMeans Clustering
--------------------
- Used KMeans algorithm with 4 clusters (n_clusters=4, random_state=42) to segment customers based on their spending, visit frequency, average order value, and preferences.
- Assigned each customer to a cluster.

4. Cluster Profiling
--------------------
- Aggregated and analyzed each cluster to determine average spend, frequency, AOV, and most common preferences.
- Used these profiles to understand the characteristics of each customer segment.

**Cluster Feature and Behavior Summary**
----------------------------------------
- The following describes the typical features and behaviors for each cluster (based on the cluster_profiles.csv output):

Cluster 0:
- **Features:** Moderate to high TotalSpend, moderate Frequency, moderate AOV.
- **Behaviors:** These customers are steady spenders, often prefer a specific dish and location, and visit regularly but not excessively. They respond well to loyalty programs and "come back soon" offers.

Cluster 1:
- **Features:** Lower TotalSpend, higher Frequency, low AOV.
- **Behaviors:** These are frequent visitors who spend less per visit. They are likely regulars who enjoy deals and combos. Upselling combo deals or value meals is effective for this group.

Cluster 2:
- **Features:** High TotalSpend, low to moderate Frequency, high AOV.
- **Behaviors:** These customers make fewer visits but spend a lot when they do, often at lunch. They are ideal for lunch-time discount bundles or special occasion offers.

Cluster 3:
- **Features:** Low TotalSpend, low Frequency, low AOV.
- **Behaviors:** These are infrequent, low-spending customers who may be at risk of churning. Reactivation coupons or limited-time offers can help bring them back.

5. Promotion Assignment
-----------------------
- Mapped each cluster to a specific promotion strategy based on its profile:
    0: Loyalty Points + 'Come Back Soon' Offer
    1: Upsell Combo Deals for Regulars
    2: Lunch-Time Discount Bundle
    3: Reactivation Coupon - Limited Time Offer

6. Visualization
----------------
- Created scatter plots to visualize customer segments and promotion assignments.
- Saved results and plots for further analysis.

Seasonal Trend Identification (ARIMA Forecasting)
=================================================

1. Data Loading and Preparation
-------------------------------
- Loaded order data from 'sample_orders.csv'.
- Converted the 'Date' column to datetime format for time series analysis.

2. Filtering and Aggregation
----------------------------
- Filtered data for a specific dish (e.g., 'Pasta').
- Aggregated daily order quantities to create a time series for the selected dish.

3. ARIMA Model Fitting
----------------------
- Used the ARIMA model (order=(2,1,2)) to fit the time series data.
- The ARIMA model captures trends, seasonality, and noise in the data.

4. Forecasting
--------------
- Forecasted the next 14 days of order quantities for the selected dish.
- Generated future dates and predicted values.

5. Visualization and Seasonal Trend Analysis
--------------------------------------------
- Plotted observed vs. forecasted order counts to visualize trends and seasonality.
- The ARIMA forecast helps identify recurring patterns, peaks, and troughs in demand, which are indicative of seasonal trends.

---

Summary
=======
- KMeans clustering segments customers for targeted promotions based on behavioral and preference data.
- ARIMA forecasting identifies and predicts seasonal trends in dish orders, enabling data-driven inventory and marketing decisions.
